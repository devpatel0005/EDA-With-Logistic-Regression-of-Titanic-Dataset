# Complete Python (Part 2): EDA with Logistic Regression

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook covers Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Logistic Regression in Python. It provides a step-by-step guide to analyzing a dataset, visualizing patterns, and building a logistic regression model to make predictions.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature selection.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions, correlations, and key insights using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Feature Engineering**: Transforming raw data into meaningful features for better model performance.
- **Logistic Regression**: Implementing logistic regression using Scikit-Learn to classify data and evaluate model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing accuracy, precision, recall, and other performance metrics using confusion matrices and ROC curves.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Complete_Python_(Part_2_EDA_with_Logistic_Regression).ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells step by step to perform data analysis and build the logistic regression model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this notebook should be placed in the working directory. Modify the data loading cell accordingly if needed.

## Output

- Graphical visualizations of data trends.
- Logistic regression model with performance metrics.
